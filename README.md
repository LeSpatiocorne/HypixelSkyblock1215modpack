# This pack is still Work in Progress
Since the foraging update is pretty new and most people (me included) haven't been playing out of the 1.8.9 until now for Skyblock, this pack may have unconfigured mods, or conflicting configuration in some edge cases or gameplay that I didn't really played recently.

# Because without mods it's sad
This modpack is a comprehensive modded version of Hypixel Skyblock, trying different mods and version to help us during our playing sessions. Most of the parameters are progressively tweaked to compel with my own preferences while playing the game.
I'm actively trying to avoid conflict between multiple mods that are integrating their own interfaces or solvers, and keeping the most efficient and readable ones to have the best of all the worlds.

# Important for ressourcepacks :
In the instance settings under "Java and Memory", check the box for custom Java Arguments and add 
```
-Xss4M
```
It should fix the "ressourcepack failed to load" error

Buttons are AI Generated, shame on me, sorry, don't have time to make great pixel art for now.
But later on I will definitively do my own version !
